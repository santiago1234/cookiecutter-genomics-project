# Cookiecutter Genomics Project Template

The goal of this template is to
organize your computational genomics projects.


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/santiago1234/cookiecutter-genomics-project


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
